# blizzard_internship
This is a repository dedicated to my internship at Blizzard Entertainment in the summer of 2020. I was the intern for the IT Corporate Applications team where I worked on developing ThinkGlobally, a project aiming to asssociate real world locations with their corresponding geographical coordinates. This program was coded in JavaScript, specifically in Vue.js.
